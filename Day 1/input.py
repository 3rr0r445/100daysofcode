#So this one would ask your name but do absolutely nothing with it.
#What you can do is use it in a string or another part of your code.
print("Hello " + input('What is your name? '))
#Note the spaces after hello, to cause a space between the word hello and the input.
#Also note the space after the input prompt, simply to give a space before where you type. Stylistic choice.
